                Thipuzu Village operates under a democratic system that blends traditional Naga governance with modern
                administrative practices. Our Village Council serves as the primary decision-making body, ensuring that
                all voices in the community are heard and represented.

                The traditional role of the Gaon Bura continues to be respected, serving as a bridge between our
                ancestral customs and contemporary governance needs. This dual system ensures both cultural continuity
                and effective administration.
